- ⚡ Fun fact: The first computer bug was an actual bug! In 1947, computer scientist Grace Hopper and her team found a moth trapped in a relay of the Harvard Mark II computer. They taped it into their logbook and noted
- it as the "first actual case of bug being found." This incident popularized the term "computer bug," which now refers to errors or glitches in software and hardware.
